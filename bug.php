In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with type juggling and comparison operators.  Consider this scenario:

```php
$value = "10";
$number = 10;
if ($value == $number) {
  echo "Values are equal";
} else {
  echo "Values are not equal";
}
```

This will output "Values are equal" because PHP's loose comparison (`==`) converts the string "10" to an integer 10 before comparison.  This can lead to unexpected behavior if strict type checking is needed.
